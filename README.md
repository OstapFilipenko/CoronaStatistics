# CoronaStatistics

## This software gets a csv-file from internet and saves it. After that this data will be saved in the datebase. There is also a visualization of it, made with javafx. You can choose a location like "Austria" and press next button. After that action you will get a bar-chart with infections on the y-Axes and dates on the x-Axes.

### Wish you a lot of fun, if you are going to check my code ;)
